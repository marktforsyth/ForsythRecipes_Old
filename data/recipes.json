This is half whole wheat. I'll be working on a more whole wheat version next. (I first heard of this from a Nov. 8 2006 NYT article.)\n\n3/4 lb. whole white wheat flour (about 2 1/4 c.)\n3/4 lb. white bread flour (about 2 1/4 c.)\nshy 1/2 t. instant yeast\nshy 2 t. salt\n2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups water\n\nIn a large container with lid, mix dry ingredients, stir in water. Make sure to get dry pockets from the bottom. Cover, not airtight, and leave on counter 12 to 18 hours (longer time preferred).  Here's how I did it this most recent time. We let it rise from evening Monday to about 3 pm the next day. I preheated to 450, then floured very well my pastry cloth, and poured the dough out onto it, sifting some flour on, and using the sides of the cloth to turn the dough so it had a floury surface everywhere. I covered it with the one side of the cloth and tucked the edges in so it could rest while the top oven heated, with the small roasting pan inside. I heated the lid, too, but the oven is too small for it to fit when on the pan, so that wasn't necessary. \nWhen the oven was heated I sprinkled some cornmeal over the dough. I pulled the pan out and put it on the stove, sprinkling some cornmeal in it, too. I then lifted the cloth with the dough and sort of tipped the dough off into the hot pan, and with hotpads sort of shook the pan to settle it in. A smear of wet dough slid down one inner edge and began to cook there. I put it in and baked it for 30 minutes, then maybe 15 more. Internal temp was above 190 at that point. We let it cool a lot before cutting so it didn't \"pill.\" It rose nice and high. \nNow back to the original directions:\n\nThe source recipe then describes a second rise, etc. but I've been making it without. Preheat oven and a cast iron skillet, dutch oven or small enamel roasting pan (11-12\" interior length) to 450. In a roaster oven, this takes about 10 minutes (we bake on the porch in the summer). A home oven might take 30 minutes. Take pan out, uncover, sprinkle with cornmeal (you may need to spray the perimeter with oil, but try it without the first time), and using a rubber scraper, pour dough into hot pan. Cover, bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 10-20 more (in the roaster oven 10 is enough). It's best to let this cool, though that meets with loud protests. If you like, don't wash out the rising container, and use it again soon for a bit of sourdough start action.\n\nNotes from Spain: \n12 oz whole wheat flour (about 350 g)\n12 oz all purpose flour (about 350 g)\nshy 1/2 t. yeast\n2 t. sea salt\n2 1/4 to 2 1/2 c. water\nMixed and left overnight about 12 hours and stirred it down. About 2 hours later, I heated the oven to 230 C, and oiled the blue enameled pot at about halfway up the sides, sprinkling cornmeal, and semola de trigo over the bottom and sizes. I shook on a little bit of sea salt, too. After about 15 minutes of preheating, I sprinkled the top of the dough with some flour and carefully scraped the dough into the pan, which I hadn't preheated. I put it in on the bottom rack, covered, for about 35 minutes, then uncovered it for 15, then laid some foil over the center for another 5 or so minutes.

I did a version today in Germany that was very interesting. I made a three-cup flour recipe of bread dough using part whole wheat, part whole spelt, part all purpose flour and part whitish spelt flour. with about a t. yeast and a teaspoon salt, plus some sunflower oil, it took about a cup of warmed liquid (broccoli cooking water this time).\n\nI divided the dough in two, and rolled half out into a thin circle. On that I spread this mixture:\n\n1 T. extra virgin olive oil\n1 t. ground coriander\n1/2 t. cayenne pepper\n1 t. chana dhal powder\n1/2 t. paprika\n1/2 t. Chinese 5 spice powder\n1/2 t. salt, which I might have preferred to be a little less\n\nI spread that mixture over the dough round to within about half an inch of the edges, or a little more. Then starting from one edge, I rolled the dough up, or sort of folder over by inches, then made a coil of that tube, then flattened that and rounded it with my hands, then floured the counter a little and rolled the dough out again. When making this at home, I have done it large, and cooked it in our largest skillet which might be 14 inches across. Here the biggest skillet is 23 cm, or not quite 10 inches. So I rolled the dough out smaller and thicker than I'm used to, and cooked it slightly differently. I heated the cast iron pan, then poured in a generous glug of olive oil to coat the bottom, then placed the bread circle in and let it cook for a while, and spread olive oil on the top with a pastry brush, shook the pan a little, turned the dough, shook some more, watched that the heat wasn't too high (I began medium to medium high, and lowered as I went along). I also covered the pan, shaking it back and forth some, turned the dough later, etc. It got nice browned places, but no black places. I was concerned it wouldn't cook through because of the thickness, but it was fine. And the bread had lots of layers, and was very good. We served it with a sort of hummus we made from brown chickpeas and lots of other fun things, and had cut raw vegetables, and a waldorf salad. \n\nThe second round of dough I used something closer to the spice mixture of the original recipe, which is here:\n\n1 T. extra virgin olive oil (the original recipe calls for 3 T., but that just runs out and makes an impressive mess)\n1 t. cumin\n1 t. turmeric\n1 t. paprika\n1/2 t. cayenne (to taste)\n1/4 t. kosher salt, plus a bit more for sprinkling later\n","creator":"YourName","created":"202004091706","modified":"202004091709"},"Aloo Curry":{"title":"Aloo Curry","body":"1 T. green chili paste\n1/2 onion, fry together\ncardomom pods, opened\ncoriander seed,\npoppy seed\ncurry powder\ngaram masala\ngarlic\ncumin (frying together)\na cup of potato (nuked)\na cup of cauliflower (nuked)\n1/2 cup frozen peas\n1 cup ish of water\nsalt (chili paste has some)\n1/2 cup yogurt\n10 ounces of tofu ish (add once the liquid is all mixed)\nthicken with a little flour\nYou could  fry some meat to use, too. \nSo frying with paste, onion, then spices, add chunky stuff, then add liquids, thicken as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n","creator":"Lori","created":"201710172326","modified":null},"Aloo Naan":{"title":"Aloo Naan","body":"This recipe is from ifood tv, http://www.ifood.tv/recipe/aloo-naan.  I made these March 27, 2013, with half whole wheat flour, only rising for about 1 hour, using 1 1/2 c. hot water to 3/4 plus 1/3 c. potato pearls for the filling. I also only had ground cumin, and I had frozen cilantro cubes that had a little oil and some lime, and I used two. This turned out very tasty. I put the pizza stone very low in the oven, and the cast iron grill above on a rack, but it made it really hard to get them in. I'll try adjusting that so it's less perilous.\n\nTo prepare the dough:\n \nAll Purpose flour (Plain flour or maida) – 2 cups\n Active dry yeast - 1 teaspoon\n Salt - 1 teaspoon\n Sugar - 1 teaspoon\n Baking soda – a pinch\n Oil - 2 tablespoons\n Yogurt (curd or dahi) - 2 tablespoons\n Lukewarm water - 3/4 cup or use as needed\n\n For the potato filling:\n Potatoes - 2 numbers, medium size\n Salt - 1 teaspoon or adjust to taste\n Cumin seeds (Jeera) - 1/2 teaspoon\n Mango powder (amchoor) - 1/2 teaspoon\n Green pepper - 1 number, chopped\n Cilantro (hara dhania) - 2 tablespoons, chopped\n Garam masala (optional) - 1/2 teaspoon\n \nAlso required:\n Oil - 2 tablespoon\n Clear butter or ghee - 2 teaspoon, to butter the Naan\n All Purpose flour - 1/4 cup for rolling\n\nDirections\nGETTING READY\n1. Preheat the oven to 500°F with baking rack for about thirty minutes or until rack is hot. Using a rack helps naan to get same heat as in a clay tandoor.\n\nMAKING\n2. To make the dough: Dissolve yeast in 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water and let it sit for 10 minutes or until the mixture becomes frothy.\n3. Add sugar, salt and baking soda to the flour and mix well.\n4. Combine oil and yogurt mix it well, this will become crumbly dough.\n5. Add the water-yeast mixture; add water as needed to make the dough firm. Note that after dough rises, it will become a little softer.\n6. Knead until the dough is smooth. Cover the dough with damp cloth and keep it in a warm place for 3-4 hours. The dough should almost double in volume.\n7. To prepare the filling: Boil 2 medium potatoes until they are tender.\n8. Once cooked, drain the water and let the potatoes cool down. Note: Do not cool the potatoes under running water. Potatoes will absorb the water and become soft.\n9. Peel the skin off and mash the potatoes.\n10. Add green pepper, cilantro, cumin seeds, mango powder, garam masala, and salt to the mashed potatoes and mix it well.\n11. To make the naan: Knead the dough for about two minutes and divide the dough into six equal parts, and divide the potato mix in six parts. Potato mix should be little smaller then dough balls.\n12. Roll the dough into a 3-inch circle. Place one potato ball in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the potato filling. Proceed to make all six balls.\n13. Let the filled balls settle for 3 to 4 minutes before rolling them.\n14. Next turn the oven to high broil.\n15. Before putting the Naan in oven, oil your palms with oil and flip naan between your palms and place onto your baking rack into the oven.\n16. You can place about 2 to 3 naan on the baking rack at a time. The naan will take about 2 to 3 minutes to cook, depending upon your oven. After the naan is baked, it should become golden brown color on top.\n17. Take naan out of the oven and brush lightly with clear butter (ghee).\n18. Wait for 2 to 3 minutes before baking the next naan. It gives oven the chance to get heated again to max.\n19. If baking rack is not available use baking sheet. After naan is cooked from top turn them over to cook from other side.\n\nSERVING\n20. Serve the naan hot with dal makhni, raita, chola or palak paneer. Enjoy!\n\nTIPS\nIf you are doubling the recipe yeast should instead of two teaspoon it should be 1 ½ teaspoon same thing applies with sugar.\nRead more at http://www.ifood.tv/recipe/aloo-naan#Ia1VPf1CihOMzL8v.99\n","creator":"Lori","created":"201303272000","modified":"201304241546"},"Amaranth Coconut pudding":{"title":"Amaranth Coconut pudding","body":"Ingredients:\n1/2 cup uncooked amaranth\n1 can light coconut milk\n4 tablespoons sugar (or to taste)\nCinnamon to sprinkle on top\nFresh fruit (blueberries, banana slices...etc) to top, optional\n\nDirections:\n1.

Place in fridge until ready to use.\nFor the apple pie filling, melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the rest of the filling ingredients and cook over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, until apples are soft but not mushy. Use a slotted spoon to strain out the apple pieces. Return the pan to the stove and continue to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes until juice is reduced to 1/3 and is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Pour thickened juice back onto apples. Let cool to room temperature.\n[i]Make the All-Butter Pie Crust[/i]\nStir the flour, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Add the butter pieces and coat with the flour mixture using a bench scraper or spatula. With a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture, working quickly until mostly pea-sized pieces of butter remain (a few larger pieces are OK; be careful not to overblend).\nCombine the water, cider vinegar, and ice in a large measuring cup or small bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the ice-water mixture over the flour mixture, and mix and cut it in with a bench scraper or spatula until it is fully incorporated. Add more of the ice-water mixture, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, using the bench scraper or your hands (or both) to mix until the dough comes together in a ball, with some dry bits remaining. Squeeze and pinch with your fingertips to bring all the dough together, sprinkling dry bits with more small drops of the ice-water mixture, if necessary, to combine. Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight, to give the crust time to mellow.\nWrapped tightly, the dough can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen for 1 month.\n[i]Make the Hand Pies:[/i]\nPreheat oven to 350F\nRoll chilled pie dough out on floured surface to approximately 1/8 inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut out forty 4-inch circles, re-rolling if necessary. Place a dollop of cream cheese in the center of half of the circles. Top with a spoonful of the apple pie filling.\nCover with another pie dough round and gently pinch the edges together. Use the tines of a fork to seal further and to create a fluted edge. Cut a small X-shaped slit on the top of each pie with a paring knife.\nUse a pastry brush to brush with heavy cream and sprinkle with raw or demerara sugar.

Sara is here, and I don't have a pie plate, and our oven is iffy, so I didn't want to invest in a full scale project, so I wanted something a little simpler. Ina Garten at food network had a nice recipe. It ended up a little burnt, either because of the sugar in the crust and topping, or the oven unpredictableness, etc., but I think it's promising. I might cut the sugar in the crust, maybe doing something closer to traditional pie crust. I used the recipe just as written, except that I added 1/4 c. quick oats to the topping. Watch it so it doesn't get too brown.\nHere are the ingredients:\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons granulated or superfine sugar\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 pound (1 stick) very cold unsalted butter, diced\n2 tablespoons ice water\nFor the filling:\n1 1/2 pounds McIntosh, Macoun, or Empire apples (3 large) (I've used golden delicious, too)\n1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest\n1/4 cup flour\n1/4 cup granulated or superfine sugar\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/8 teaspoon ground allspice (or a bit of cloves and nutmeg)\n4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced (more or less)\n\nFor the pastry, place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the dough onto a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F. (My oven was unpredictable, so I had the heat lower, maybe not quite 400, and I baked for longer.)\n\nFlour a rolling pin and roll the pastry into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet. (Or you could flour a silicone sheet, and then you wouldn't have to move it, but getting the edges loose so they can fold up might be tough.)\n\nFor the filling, peel, core, and cut the apples into 8ths. Cut each wedge into 3 chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. (I cut apples much smaller, and I mixed the zest in with the other ingredients below.) Cover the tart dough with the apple chunks leaving a 1 1/2-inch border.\n\nCombine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Pour into a bowl and rub it with your fingers until it starts holding together. Sprinkle evenly on the apples (I tossed the apples with it so it was mixed throughout). Gently fold the border over the apples to enclose the dough, pleating it to make a circle. (I didn't have enough to do more than just come part way up the sides.)\n\nBake the crostata for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and the apples are tender. Allow to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. \n\nIn 2019 I made this with only about 18 oz apples, other filling ingredients the same. One time I also increased the crust by half. It was a warm day, and though I chilled it, the dough was super hard to handle. In similar circumstances I'd probably do it as press-in dough. I did it in two loaf pans, sort of just up the two long sides a bit, and folded a bit over the filling. Also, when I increased the dough ingredients, I didn't increase the sugar, and it was fine. I'd also consider rolling the circle out onto parchment paper, and then if it stuck, I could just wrap the paper up around it and let it bake like that. Even with all the difficulty of managing the crust dough, the taste was worth it. But this sort of thing could also be made with another sort of crust recipe, I'm sure.\n\nhttp://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/apple-crostata-recipe.html\n\nGermany 2019 notes: I did part oil in the crust because we were out of butter. I rolled crust between parchment paper and plastic wrap, and that worked well, though it didn't come away from the paper easily to wrap up around the apples. The apples were from a nearby tree, and were quite hard, so it took a long time to bake them soft enough. I also didn't read carefully and didn't mix the butter with the dry ingredients for the topping, but stirring them together worked okay.","creator":"Lori","created":"201603271138","modified":"201909211421"},"Apple Filo Pie with Maple and Pecans":{"title":"Apple Filo Pie with Maple and Pecans","body":"Give this a look:\nhttp://drizzleanddip.com/2013/02/20/apple-phyllo-pie-with-pecans-and-maple","creator":"Lori","created":"201304082118","modified":null},"Apple Pie":{"title":"Apple Pie","body":"A good, basic apple pie:\nhttps://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/perfect-apple-pie/1fc2b60f-0a4f-441e-ad93-8bbd00fe5334\n\nIngredients\n\n1 double crust\n\n6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium)\n3/4 cup sugar\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1.

Layer a couple of half sheets of filo in bottom, brush with melted butter, layer 2 more, repeat with a bit less than half the sheets. sprinkle in 1/2 the nut mixture. layer 1/2 remaining sheets, brushing butter every one or two. Last of nut mixture, remaining filo sheets, finishing with butter. With a sharp knife, but into 4 rows by 6 rows. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes. \n\nCook syrup to barely boiling near the end of the time; remove from heat and add 2 t. lemon juice and 1/2 t. vanilla.

Let cool while you're baking the baklava.\n\nKeeping a damp cloth on the pastry sheets, lay half sheets down on a silpat sheet on a roaster pan, using pasty brush to butter each sheet. The reference recipe I used has you lay down 10 sheets then 4 groups of 5 sheets followed by 10 sheets, but they must be using very different filo from me, as my total was only half sheets. So I put down about 4, then nut mixture, then another, then nut mixture, then a couple more, etc. so there's more on top and bottom, and some between nut layers. When all done, bake at 165 C. The reference says 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes. In our convection oven that likes to be hot, I checked at 20 minutes and it was getting quite browned, so I turned off the upper element. It finally baked about a total of 30 minutes. Right when you take it out, carefully pour the syrup over the hot pastry, which will sizzle. Let it sit for 4-6 hours or overnight.

She didn't have lemon zest so I used a bit of lemon essential oil; lime juice instead of lemon juice; regular sugar for sprinkling; chopped almonds instead of flaked; no almond flavoring. I used a packet of vanilla sugar instead of vanilla. I used a cup of frozen red mixed berries for the blueberries and 3 cups of fresh blackberries. Combo of flours, including some spelt flour, whole wheat and some something that's a sort of whole wheat light. They had no mixer, so I was hand mixing butter and sugar, so obviously didn't beat it for 3 minutes. Overall I followed the recipe fairly closely. I baked it in a 9 x 13 with the bottom element only for about 15 minutes, then the top element too for 5 or 7, then bottom element alone for some more, perhaps a total of 32 or 33 or so. The edges were getting golden brown by the time I took it out. We let it cool for 20 minutes or so, and had it with vanilla ice cream. They compared it to linzertort. \n\nINGREDIENTS\nFOR THE FILLING (for which you can also substitute 1 1/2 cups already made jam, or 400 g):\n3 cups/340 grams blackberries\n1 cup/125 grams blueberries\n¾ cup/150 grams granulated sugar, plus more as needed\n2 teaspoons minced fresh lemon verbena (optional)\n1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed\n½ teaspoon grated lemon zest\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n⅓ cup sliced almonds\n Demerara sugar, for sprinkling\nFOR THE CRUST:\n1 ½ cups/190 grams all-purpose flour\n¾ cup/95 grams whole-wheat flour\n12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), softened\n½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar\n2 large egg yolks, at room temperature\n1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n½ teaspoon fine sea salt\n¼ teaspoon almond extract\n \nPREPARATION\nMake the jam: In a medium saucepan, stir together blackberries, blueberries, sugar and lemon verbena, if using. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first, then more frequently as the mixture starts to bubble and reduce.\nWhen mixture has reduced and looks syrupy (about 30 minutes total), stir in lemon juice and zest. Taste and add sugar if necessary. (This depends on how sweet your berries were to begin with.) Cook for 3 minutes longer, stirring frequently to prevent burning. When the jam is thickened and shiny but still slightly runnier than you expect jam to be, take it off the heat; it will continue to thicken as it cools.\nScrape jam into a bowl or heatproof container, stir in vanilla and let cool to room temperature. Taste and stir in a little more lemon juice if the jam seems very sweet. At this point, the cooled jam can be chilled for up to 1 week.\nMake the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, and set aside. In a second bowl and using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg yolks, lemon zest, vanilla, salt and almond extract until combined, then beat in flour mixture.\nScoop 1/2 cup of the dough into a bowl or container, cover and chill. Transfer remaining dough to a 9- or 10-inch tart pan and use floured fingers to press evenly into bottom and sides. Chill crust in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.\nWhen ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread jam evenly into crust, then using your fingers, crumble reserved 1/2 cup dough over jam. Sprinkle with almonds and Demerara sugar.\nBake until golden, 38 to 48 minutes. Let cool completely to room temperature before serving.\n\nJanuary 2020 Apricot variation: I did the crust as indicated, using a few drops of lemon essential oil instead of zest, and no almond flavoring, also one egg instead of two yokes.

Store leftovers loosely covered and eat within a day or two.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe riper the banana, the sweeter your end result will be. I’ve used rolled oats (like you see here) and quick oats, both with great success. Also, I’ve had batches come out looking lighter than what you see here, usually when using quick oats, so your coloring may vary. They may also darken a bit overnight due to the banana.\n\nI’ve made this recipe many times since sharing. I find that each time my mixture might be a little different. It’s never been too dry but sometimes seems too wet. This may be that my bananas were large, or extra ripe and soft. If you happen to think the mixture is too wet, add more oats.\n\nYou can play around with adding more bananas and oats making a larger batch as well. Since these don’t spread on the baking sheet. I’ve made 24 on an average baking sheet.\n\nTry using this DIY Muesli Mix in place of plain oats.

Mix with the other ingredients and place in a pan, probably 9x9 or 10x12. Bake at about 300 for about 20 minutes; it's a little hard to tell when the coconut is toasted because of the chocolate, but sniffing is helpful. Cool in the pan and break up into chunks. I saw this referred to as a granola, but I'll just be snacking on it. \n\nHere's the recipe I based mine on, from the stonesoup blog that sends me emails:\n Chocolatey Coconut Granola\n\nAdapted from the ‘I Quit Sugar Chocolate Cookbook‘ by Sarah Wilson.\n\nIf the thought of chocolate for breakfast gets you excited, I highly recommend starting with this granola. It’s seriously delicious served on top of home made natural yoghurt or coconut yoghurt. And in case you’re wondering, I have chia seed bran in the bottom of the glass in the photo above.\n\nSarah uses rice malt syrup to sweeten many of her recipes. Most good health food stores will stock it, but you could use honey instead. I really love the flavor of rice malt syrup, it’s not super sweet and has a lovely malty slightly carameley flavour. I also love that it’s a natural ingredient produced from brown rice.\n\n    75g (3oz) butter or coconut oil\n    3 tablespoons rice malt syrup\n    30g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder, preferably raw\n    150g (5oz) coconut flakes\n    250g (9oz) chopped nuts\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 150C (300F).\n2. Melt butter or coconut oil in a small saucepan. Add rice malt syrup and cocoa powder. Stir.\n3. Combine coconut and nuts in a bowl. Stir in the cocoa syrup mixture until the flakes are just coated.\n4. Spread mixture on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. Stop when the coconut is well browned (which can be difficult to tell through the cocoa) or everything tastes roasted and yummy.\n5. Cool and transfer to an airtight container. Will keep for a few months at room temperature.\n\nVARIATIONS\noptional additives – Sarah also includes cinnamon (1 teaspoon), chia seeds (2 tablespoons) and cocoa nibs (2 tablespoons) in her recipe. So feel free to add in any or all of these. But honestly I prefer this simple 5 ingredient version.\ndifferent nuts – I used brazil nuts and pecans but feel free to use any nut you like.\ndifferent sweetener / no rice malt syrup – If you can find rice malt syrup or aren’t interested in investing in a new sweetener, feel free to use honey instead. Glucose syrup or dextrose could also be used. Or if you have stevia in the house that’s another option.\nvegan – make sure you use coconut oil instead of the butter.\nnut-free - if you’re catering for nut allergies, you could replace the nuts with extra coconut (just double the amount of coconut and skip the nuts) or use a combo of coconut and seeds such as pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds – whatever you feel like.\n","creator":"Lori","created":"201306060030","modified":"201306060118"},"Chocolate Cream Pie in Spain":{"title":"Chocolate Cream Pie in Spain","body":"13 oz (400 ml) whipping cream\n7 oz (200 gr) chocolate-hazelnut cream, such as Nocilla or Nutella\n3.5 oz (100 gr) dark chocolate bar with at least 70% cocoa\n5 large eggs\n1/3 cup (2.5 oz or 75 gr) granulated sugar\n1.75 oz (50gr) chopped almonds\n4 oz (112 gr) butter\n2 cups crushed Maria crackers (or graham crackers)\n2 egg whites\ncocoa powder (unsweetened) for dusting\n\nPlace a rack in the center and heat the oven to 360F (180C) degrees.\n\nPrepare the filling.

I've made this quite a few times and it's always a huge hit. Giant bubbles and a golden crust. Best part is you can do the whole thing in about 4-5 hours. It does not use the traditional stretch/fold method for a ciabatta because it's so damn wet, the only stretch is the final shaping.\"\n\nCiabatta Bread Ciabatta Bread\nVariation 1\n\n500g bread flour \n475g (~2 cups) water\n2 tsp. yeast \n15g salt\n\nVariation 2 (Semolina, haven't tried yet)\n\n350g bread flour \n150g semolina flour \n475-485g (~2cups) water \n2tsp. yeast \n15g salt\n\nIn Kitchen Aid style mixer: Mix all ingredients roughly till combined with a wooden spoon, let it rest for 10 minutes.\nWith the hook to prevent the dough from crawling into the guts of the mixer, beat the living daylights out of the batter; it will start out like pancake batter but in anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes it will set up and work like a very sticky dough. if it starts climbing too soon, then switch to the hook. You'll know it's done when it separates from the side of the bowl and starts to climb up your hook/paddle and just coming off the bottom of the bowl. I mean this literally about the climbing, i once didn't pay attention and it climbed up my paddle into the greasy inner workings of the mixer. It was not pretty! Anyway, it will definitely pass the windowpane test.\nPlace into a well oiled container and let it triple! it must triple! For me this takes about 2.5 hours (Mine was closer to 1.5. I measured how high the dough was in an ice cream bucket, and then measured up to triple and marked it so I would know when.)\nEmpty on to a floured counter (scrape if you must, however you can get the gloop out), cut into 4 pieces. Spray with oil and dust with lots o' flour. Let them proof for about 45 minutes, which gives you enough time to crank that oven up to 500F. (I waited 15 min, then preheated, and it was just right.) (I'm interested in trying to put the dough onto the floured counter rather neatly because that will be the top of the bread. My first ones were a little haphazard.)\nAfter 45 minutes or so the loaves should be puffy and wobbly, now it's iron fist, velvet glove time. Pick up and stretch into your final ciabatta shape (~10\" oblong rectangle) and flip them upside down (this redistributes the bubbles, so you get even bubbles throughout), and onto parchment or a heavily floured peel. Try to do it in one motion and be gentle, it might look like you've ruined them completely, but the oven spring is immense on these things. (Once I want to see what it's like baking without flipping.)\nBake at 500F until they are 205F in the center (about 15-20 minutes. I only got to 200 before the first one came out, but very tasty), rotating 180 degrees half way through. Some people like to turn the oven down to 450F after 10 minutes, but whatever floats your boat. I usually bake in 2 batches.\n\n\nThis next version was not super successful, but I was using yeast past its prime.

Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture is well mixed and free of lumps.\nCover the bowl will plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, at least 12 hours but up to 24 hours. This will add a lot of structure and flavor to the finished bread.\nMake the bread\nRemove the sponge from the refrigerator and add the remaining water. Gently run a rubber spatula around the outer edge to release the sponge from the bowl. The water you just added will make this easier.\nTransfer the sponge mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the remaining flour and salt.\nBeat on low speed for 1 minute. Turn the speed up one notch and beat for another minute. Then turn the speed up one more notch and beat until the dough starts to release from the sides of the bowl, about 4 minutes.\nDrizzle the olive oil in a large bowl and rub it around to evenly coat the inside of the bowl. With wet hands, transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes. \nUsing a well-greased scraper, gently fold the dough over onto itself. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for another 45 minutes. Repeat this step once more and let the dough rise for a final 45 minutes.\nLiberally flour your work surface with flour and let the dough slide out of the bowl onto the counter. Be very gently here so you don’t knock all the air out of the dough and try to handle the dough as little as possible.\nLiberally dust the top of the dough with flour. Using 2 well-floured bench scrapers, carefully manipulate the dough from the sides to form a square. Take care not to put pressure on top of the dough. \nCut the dough in half, down the middle of the square. Gently shape each half into 2 loaves by using the bench scrapers to manipulate the sides.\nLay a lint-free baking towel over a large baking sheet and liberally dust it with flour. Using both bench scrapers, slide them under both ends of the dough and transfer the dough to the prepared cloth. Fold the cloth up in the middle to separate and support the loaf. Repeat with the remaining loaf.\nCover the dough with another lint-free cloth and let it rest for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, adjust the oven rack to the lowest position. Place a large inverted baking sheet on the rack and preheat the oven to 450F. \nCut 2 pieces of parchment paper to about 12×6-inches. Place the parchment paper on a pizza peel or inverted rimmed baking sheet. \nUsing the cloth, gently roll the first dough loaf over to loosen it. Carefully slide your fingers under each end of the dough and transfer it to the prepared parchment paper. Repeat with the second loaf. \nDust off any excess flour and spray the loaves lightly with water\nCarefully slide the parchment with loaves on the heated baking sheet in the oven using a jerking motion.\nBake, spraying the loaves with water twice more during the first 5 minutes of baking time, until the crust is a deep golden brown, about 22-27 minutes. The internal temperature of the bread should be 205-210°F.\nTransfer to an oven rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.\n\nNext I'll try the recipe at this link: http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread","creator":"Lori","created":"201905310045","modified":"201908011839"},"Ciabatta with Gorgonzola":{"title":"Ciabatta with Gorgonzola","body":"For the biga:\n\nMix together well and leave for 12-20 hours until quite bubbly\n1 cup whole white wheat flour\n3/4 cup bread flour\n1/8 t. instant yeast\n1 cup water\n\nDough:\n\nthe biga from the previous night\n1 cup whole wheat flour (also try 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and decrease bread flour to 1 cup)\n1 1/2 cup bread flour\n1/2 cup water\n1 1/2 t. salt\n1/2 t. instant yeast\nAfter mixing and the first rise, add the cheese:\n1/2 to 3/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese, added during second kneading\n\nThe dough can be mixed in the bread machine, and the cheese added so it gets kneaded in at the end.

Food Stylist: Vivian Lui.\n\nThis stunning bread is made from 16 small cinnamon rolls that are arranged in a loaf pan, creating a swirled pattern that’s surprisingly easy to achieve. The bread is delicious served slightly warm, but if you want to see precise spirals in your slice, let it cool completely before slicing. The icing is meant to be quite thick; if you apply it while the loaf is still warm, it will remain soft and gooey. If you apply it once the bread is fully cooled, it will harden to a thick, glossy frosting.

If needed, let cool to the correct temperature before using.\nWhile the milk heats, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt to combine. Add the warm milk, butter and egg and mix on low speed until the dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Scrape the bowl well, and mix on medium speed for another 3 minutes.\nTransfer to a lightly greased medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until puffy and almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nWhile the dough rises, make the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the butter and brown sugar until well combined. Whisk in the flour, cinnamon, vanilla and salt until well incorporated.\nWhen the dough has risen, roll it out into into a rectangle (about 12 by 20 inches) on a lightly floured surface using a lightly floured rolling pin. Spread the filling over the dough in an even layer all the way to the edges. Starting on one of the long sides, tightly roll up the dough crosswise into a 20-inch log. Gently stretch the log to make it about 24 inches long.\nUse a sharp or serrated knife to cut the dough into 16 1 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the loaf pan: Place two rows of six pieces each at the bottom of the pan, side-by-side, seam-side down and tightly packed with the swirls facing the ends of the pan. Arrange the remaining four pieces in the center on top of those on the bottom.\nLoosely cover the loaf with plastic wrap and let rise until the dough comes about 1 inch over the top edge of the pan, about 1 hour (it can be more if your room temperature is cooler). Toward the end of the rise time, heat the oven to 350 degrees.\nMake an egg wash by lightly beating one egg and 1 tablespoon water together. Brush the loaf with the egg wash, then bake until the loaf has an internal temperature of 200 degrees, about 50 to 55 minutes. The loaf will brown quickly; tent it with foil after 20 to 25 minutes for the remainder of baking time.\nWhile the loaf bakes, make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk the confectioners’ sugar, cream and vanilla to combine. The mixture should be thick, more like a frosting than a glaze. Add more cream if needed to achieve a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap into the surface of the frosting so the surface doesn’t harden.\nLet the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Use a small offset spatula to loosen the loaf from the short edges of the pan, then lift out the loaf using the parchment paper and cool for at least 30 minutes on a cooling rack before applying the frosting. Spread the frosting in an even layer over the surface of the loaf.","creator":"Lori","created":"201905031357","modified":null},"Cinnamon Rolls":{"title":"Cinnamon Rolls","body":"Jon asked for cinnamon rolls, and I asked him how he wanted them to be.

I’d usually show up after a long run, which meant I was hungry. Really hungry. And I discovered there was nothing more satisfying after pounding the pavement for a dozen-plus miles than a huge (I’m actually embarrassed to admit how huge) helping of watermelon, followed soon thereafter by a granola bar from local Uprise Bakery. These $2.50 chunks of goodness were an amazing blend of peanut butter, chocolate chips, oats, honey, cranberries, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and a few other ingredients that I could never seem to recreate in my own kitchen.\n\nUntil recently.

I have a friend who makes toffee, and she says that the quality of butter you use makes a difference; lower moisture is better. I make this with the store brand, and we manage to eat it, but I think I can see the point she's making. When I made it for Christmas 2013, the butter sort of separated into oil and solids, which was weird.\n\nButter 8\" square pan. Spread:\n1 c. chopped walnuts\n\nHeat and boil, stirring constantly, in a heavy sauce pan: \n3/4 c. packed brown sugar\n1/2 c. butter\n\nCook until mixture darkens and just begins to smoke, about 7 minutes. Don't get too dark.\nPour immediately over the nuts. Sprinkle on:\n\n1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, and cover with a cookie sheet to hold in the heat so it melts the chips. Spread with a knife. If desired sprinkle on ground walnuts. Score while still warm. Refrigerate, then break when cool. \n\nThe Grangers' toffee recipe is this: Spread 1/2 c. chipped almonds in a buttered 9x13 pan. Cook: 1 c. butter (see note above), 1 c. brown sugar; boil exactly 12 minutes, stirring constantly. Mix in 1/2 c. chipped almonds in to toffee, spread onto the nuts in pan. break up 4 standard hershey bars (we'd probably use chips here). Spread chocolate as it melts. Chill and then break into pieces. \n\nI recently found a recipe on a site called cooking for engineers. It appeals to me because it's precise and gives clear instructions. You can find it here: http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/159/English-Toffee\n\nHere's what I tried:\n340 g. chocolate chips (2 cups)\n400 g. sugar (2 cups)\n60 g. sliced almonds (Lisa doesn't like nuts, so this was for sprinkling on half the batch)\n2 t. vanilla (which I forgot in the tension of the difficulties that follow)\n450 g. butter (if using unsalted, add 1/4 t. salt)\n2 t. water\nIn medium saucepan melt the butter, sugar and water, on very low heat. Some suggest keeping the sugar in the middle, to avoid crystals on the sides.\nThen, stir constantly on medium high heat while the water boils off and mixture swells. It will collapse and thicken, temp rising rapidly. At Utah altitudes, 300 degrees is too high. The suggestion is lower target temp by 1 degree for every 500 ft. of altitude above sea level, so that's 9 degrees, as we're at 4700 ft here. \nWhen the temp is reached (or hard crack stage, more about that here: http://www.cooksinfo.com/hard-crack-stage) remove from heat, stir in vanilla, spread on a silpat sheet in a jelly roll pan, sprinkle with chocolate, let it melt, then spread evenly. Sprinkle with nuts. Robbyn lines her sheets with foil, then lots of toasted nuts, and pours the candy over the top. After the chocolate she sprinkles a few nuts on top of that. Heres was a lot thicker than mine, but that's probably because of all the nuts.\n\n","creator":"Lori","created":"201304242059","modified":"201712111911"},"Estonian Kringel":{"title":"Estonian Kringel","body":"Go here to see pictures and the method: http://www.justlovecookin.com/2011/11/estonian-kringel.html and scroll down to see English recipe, which I copied below, with modifications.

I've written the recipe out on my blog, and include it here:\n\nA Little Lightning-fast Lemon Curd\n\n    1 egg\n    1/3 cup sugar (73 grams) \n    1/3 cup (65-75 g) freshly squeezed lemon juice, seeds removed (pulp okay)\n    1 to 3 tablespoons melted butter (14-42 g.)\n    finely grated and chopped zest of one lemon, optional\n\nLately I've been putting the citrus peel in a little chopper with the sugar and blending that very well; it makes it easier to get the zest small, and infuses the sugar with the flavor. I have also used a clean jam jar to melt the butter in (weighed in the jar), and then when the curd is done I store it in that, saving on the washing up.\n\nIn a microwave-safe bowl (6 to 8 cup size), whisk the egg and sugar until smooth. Gradually whisk in lemon juice, melted butter and zest. Heat on high in microwave for 1 minute. Scrape sides well and stir, then cook at 45-second intervals, scraping and stirring after each. The mixture will swell and bubble (the reason for the big bowl).\n\nCooking time will vary, but it’s likely to be done after 3 or 4 cycles; the lemon curd is ready when it is thick enough to stick to the back of a spoon. It will thicken as it cools. Transfer to a container for storing in the fridge, unless you’ve got a few friends on hand and the makings of some lovely toast, in which case the storage step is likely to be unnecessary. I’ve also had good luck making lime curd using the stove-top recipe, and I assume it would work well to substitute lime juice in this one, too. Citrus sunshine for sweetening your day.","creator":"JonF","created":"201104290048","modified":"202004071301"},"Lemon Custard, from the Hardys":{"title":"Lemon Custard, from the Hardys","body":"2 T. butter\n1 c. sugar, or possibly 3/4?

There are notes here for different methods and variations.\t\t\n\n1 heaping teaspoon instant dry yeast\n3 cup (1 lb.) whole white wheat flour, or substitute about 2/3 c. bread flour for some of that\n1 heaping teaspoon salt\n1-3 teaspoons sugar or other sweetener, as desired; can be omitted; I usually leave it out\n \n1 ½ to 1 2/3 cup very warm water \na jigger of oil (1/2 to 1 T.); can be omitted, especially for pizza crust or baguette\nany number of additions: for recent soft pretzel knots I added 2 T. flax seed meal; I often add 2-4 T. of various seeds.\n\n Mix dry ingredients in work bowl of a food processor briefly. Warm tap water in microwave up to 1 min 30 seconds, not so hot that it would be uncomfortable to drink (yeast doesn’t like water above about 110 degrees; because it’s mixed with dry ingredients, it can take a bit hotter, but not much). Add a little oil, and pour in a pencil-thick stream while machine is running. Once all liquid is added, begin timing, and process about 1 minute. Dough should collect in a ball around the center post, and have an even consistency (no globs of stiffer dough). Sometimes you need to use a butter knife to cut through it a few times and then process a bit more to get it consistent. You want the dough to be soft, but not too soft. Add a few tablespoons of flour if you need to.\n\nIf you don't have a food processor, you can do this in a stand mixer, though you'll let the machine knead it for longer, maybe 3 to 5 minutes (I have done this a few times, but don't know the ideal mixing time yet). If you make this by hand, the mixing order is usually different: begin with the liquid, stirring in the dry mixture, stirring as you go, and add flour until you get a dough consistency, then knead by hand for about 10 minutes. This is good exercise, and can be very meditative. \n\nWhichever way you get there, the next stage is this: turn out onto a floured cloth (I use a pastry cloth that I keep floury and folded in a drawer for the purpose) and toss a few times to dust with flour. Place in a bowl and cover with a clean dish towel (I don’t oil the bowl or cover in plastic as some recommend; it saves effort, seems to work better). Let rise until a wet finger poke doesn’t fill in, 30-50 minutes or so. With wet hand, deflate dough and let rise again (may take a bit less time). Deflate again and toss on floured cloth, shaping as desired. \n\nI often make two long baguettes, or two mini-loaves end to end in a 9x5 pan. The advantage of that is that if you’re at all in doubt whether the bread has baked long enough, you can break the loaves apart where they join and examine the crumb to make sure it’s no longer wet or grayish. From observing the outside, loaf is done when it sounds hollow when tapped, slips easily from pan, and springs back when squeezed or poked. These days I use an instant-read thermometer; a reading of 190-200 lets you know it’s done. This dough will also make 16-18 rolls. For pretzel knots, roll into a flat rectangle, use a pizza cutter to cut along the short side in about 3/4\" widths, then once down the center of the long side. You'll probably get about 4 dozen or so. Tie them in a little knot and place on an oiled sheet or a silicone baking sheet.\n\nOnce dough is shaped, let rise again until double, preheating the oven near the end of the rise. Ovens vary, but I bake my baguettes at 375-400 about 20-25 minutes, loaf 350-375 about 35-40. Hot bread tears well if you must fall upon it, but slicing is another matter, so let it cool a bit before wielding the knife, using a sharp serrated knife and lots of back and forth sawing, hardly any downward pressure.  \n \nIf I’ve got cooked pumpkin or mashed potatoes, I add about 1/2 cup, adding water to it to make up the liquid measure, heating as described. I then add a bit more water if needed. I also use leftover oatmeal, yogurt, applesauce, etc. A beaten egg can be added (though be careful not to cook it; just stir into warmed water to make up the liquid measure) which adds richness. If you like, cutting in a few tablespoons of butter is nice for the texture, too, especially for rolls. There are countless variations you can do; your family will be more than happy to help you eat your experiments as you figure out what you all like best!\n\nI gave a bread baking class several years ago, and include here some notes from that presentation that may prove helpful.\n\n\tI'm passionate about homemade, whole wheat bread, and so am about to make many bold claims and exhortations.  I hope I can inspire you to giving it a try.  To my way of thinking, the value of baking good bread at home outweighs all of the substantial reasons not to, which include yeast phobia and hectic schedules, among others.  Homemade whole wheat bread is a marvelous thing: it communicates caring, it smells irresistible, it tempts people to the table, and nutritionally it's at its best. All well and good, you say, but who has time?  Well, you do, probably: it takes about half an hour, spread out over 3 or 4 hours.  If you never have an at-home stretch of 3 or 4 hours, perhaps you've let your life get too busy.   Rather than wait until life becomes simpler before learning to bake bread, you can use baking bread as a means of making life simpler.  Let it carve out some time for you at home that can't be cut into by other activities (except emergencies, of course: just sling the dough in the fridge and be off, if need be).  The next time the Brownie troop needs to be ferried somewhere, you can say, \"I'm sorry, I can't; I've got bread rising.\"\n\n\tMost people are fans of homemade bread, but perhaps you have your doubts about whole wheat bread.  How many of you have ever made or eaten bad whole wheat bread?  I began baking bread in high school, and I told myself it was great, better than anything from a store.  I needed some convincing, because it wasn't really great: it was dense and crumbly and had an off taste to it.  Pessimists might say that that's just the nature of whole wheat bread.  As it happened, the off taste was due to rancid flour, and the dense crumbly texture to insufficient kneading.  I don't always make perfect loaves even now, but there's always good, and sometimes they're sublime.  One thing that causes trouble for people in making whole wheat bread is trying to make it as much like white bread as possible.  I am quite biased, so to me that seems like being disappointed that one can't make fresh squeezed orange juice taste more like Tang.  My goal is to help you make such good whole wheat bread that you and your families will not only eat it because it's good for you but will actually prefer it.  It can be done.\n\n\tGreat whole wheat bread comes from fresh ingredients, lots of kneading and plenty of time.  The easy way to do the kneading is in the food processor, but hurrying the bread after that point compromises its texture, flavor and keeping quality.  If that's not a concern, as for pizza crust which will be eaten in a sitting under flavorful topping, you can double the yeast and let it rise only once before rolling out.  Everyone establishes her own routine.  Mine turns out to be, 10 or 15 minutes to mix, rise for 30-60 minutes, punch down, rise about 30 minutes, punch down, shape, rise about 20 minutes, turn on oven, put in ten minutes later, bake about 25-40 minutes.  There is time for errands between risings, or if something comes up, I throw it in the fridge.  \n\nThe things that make the most difference for me in making really wonderful bread are:\n\nFresh flour.  If you don't have a grinder, those of us who do would be glad for you to visit us.  Also, natural foods stores stock it.\nHard white spring wheat: it makes lighter bread, more easily digestible, and so is ideal for helping with the transition to whole grain cooking.  Ask me about sources. \t\nMaking sure the bread dough has an even consistency. I usually make mine fairly soft. If I'm in doubt, I add liquid until it's a little too wet and then add a few tablespoons of flour until it's back to \"just right\" and can be handled.\nA pastry cloth: 24\" x 24\" should work: I think mine is canvas, but I have used a pillow case in a pinch.  It allows you to make a softer dough, using less flour, with less problem of sticking.\nTwo rises before the shaping.  This allows the bread to develop really good texture, flavor and keeping quality.  If the prospect keeps you from wanting to bake, do one rise. \n\nNotes on ingredients:\n\nWhole grain flours begin losing their nutrients within a short while of grinding, so ideally flour ought to make its way to bread within a day or two.  Flour can be kept from turning rancid, and some of the nutrient loss is slowed if flour is refrigerated or frozen (although I understand that vitamin E doesn't survive freezing).  It will still be worth baking with flour whose vitamin B isn't at its peak, but rancid flour cannot be redeemed, even with butter and honey on the finished slice. \nYeast bought in bulk is astronomically cheaper, and keeps in the freezer for ages.  warehouse stores have it in pound bricks for a few dollars or so, which is about a 40 fold savings over the grocery store packets.\nYou can make good bread without salt, fat, or sweeteners, but it takes some effort, and it beyond the scope of this demonstration.  If those factors are of interest, ask me.\n  \n\nI highly recommend the book The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book, by Robertson, Flinders and Godfrey.  It gives very detailed instructions, as well as troubleshooting, and many great recipes.  I have it and can lend it out for short periods of time.\n","creator":"Lori Forsyth","created":"201111171729","modified":"201410291504"},"Lovelight Chiffon Cake":{"title":"Lovelight Chiffon Cake","body":"We used this recipe for Sara's wedding.

This also tastes really great with chicken stock instead of vegetable broth.\n\nIngredients\n\n    1 Tbsp canola oil\n    1 1/2 oz [40 g] fresh ginger, peeled; half chopped and half cut into thin matchsticks\n    3 scallions, finely chopped\n    2 medium carrots, peeled and cut on the diagonal into 1/2-in [12-mm] pieces\n    9 1/2 oz [270 g] seeded, peeled fall squash, such as butternut, cut into 1/2‑in [12-mm] cubes\n    Freshly ground black pepper\n    2 1/2 Tbsp white miso paste\n    1/2 tsp chili oil, sesame chili oil, or hot-pepper sauce\n    1 Tbsp soy sauce\n    6 cups [1.4 L] Vegetable Stock or canned low-sodium broth\n    14 oz [400 g] udon or ramen wheat noodles\n    1 cup [230 g] peeled, thinly sliced sunchokes or sliced water chestnuts (optional)\n    1/2 cup [30 g] packed chopped mustard greens or other spicy fresh greens (optional)\n\nInstructions\n\n1. In a large stockpot over low heat, warm the canola oil. Add all the ginger and half the scallions and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the carrots and squash, season with pepper, and cook, stirring, for another 3 minutes. Add the miso paste and stir until the vegetables are well coated, then add the chili oil, soy sauce, and vegetable stock. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to low, partially cover, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender.\n\n2. Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and boil them for about 3 minutes, or until just tender. Transfer the noodles to a colander and drain.\n\n3. Divide the noodles among mugs or bowls and top with equal portions of broth and vegetables. Top with the remaining scallions and the sunchokes and mustard greens, if desired, and serve.\n\nTO GO: Boil the noodles at home but cook them for only 2 minutes. Drain them and let cool. Pack the noodles with about 1/3 cup [80 ml] of the cooking liquids (so they don’t clump up and stick together) in a covered container. Pack the sunchokes and mustard greens separately. Reheat the soup at the party. Be sure to drain the noodles before adding to the hot soup, where they will finish cooking.","creator":"Lori","created":"201610041337","modified":null},"Miso dressing":{"title":"Miso dressing","body":"This goes on a brown rice salad, and would be nice elsewhere, too.\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 T. agave syrup\n1 t. miso\n2 T. oil\n2 T. balsamic vinegar\n4 T. toasted sesame seeds\n\nBlend well.","creator":"Lori Forsyth","created":"201208071500","modified":"201301291840"},"Miso soup":{"title":"Miso soup","body":"With the current light brown miso we have, the proportion that seems to work is \n24 g. miso\n1 1/4 c. hot water (filling the Ikea stoneware bowls)\nAdd:\nnori strips\ntofu\nchopped scallion greens\nbrown rice, as desired.","creator":"Lori Forsyth","created":"201209271640","modified":null},"Mock Nachos":{"title":"Mock Nachos","body":"Also known as Cheesy Lentils\n\n1 onion, chopped (or 2-4 T. dried onion, reconstituted)\n1-2 T. oil\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 c. split red lentils\n2 1/2 c. water (potato water is good if you have it)\n\n\nchili powder\n(chopped canned or fresh jalapeño)\nsalt as needed\n1 c. grated cheddar cheese (sharp will be more flavorful, but anything works)\n\nSaute onion well in oil (if you're using dried onion, add a few more tablespoons of water to the measure if you like, and skip the saute step); add garlic, and chili powder if using.

It's very tasty, very easy, and can take some or all white whole wheat flour. I'm using weights here, as it's easier, when in Spain, to use the scale; we don't have measuring cups here.\n\nFor the topping: in each of 2 silicone bread pans, melt 25 g butter, sprinkle chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans are great), about 35 g brown sugar, crushed or chopped pineapple\n\nIn bowl with steep sides, mix for 2 minutes at medium speed:\n225-240 g flour                  (1 3/4 c.;half or all whole wheat will work, though it will be a bit heavier)\n225 g sugar                       (1 1/8 - 1 1/4 c. sugar)\n75 g soft butter                  (1/3 c.) soft butter\n2 1/2 t. baking powder\n1 t. salt\n160 ml milk                         (2/3 c. milk)\n\nAdd and mix for 2 more minutes:\n1 egg\n80 ml milk                            (1/3 c. milk)\n1 t. vanilla (or, for lemon cake: 1/4 t. vanilla, 3/4 t. lemon extract)\n\nThese directions are for when you're making the regular cake. Adapt for upside-down cake. I'll note that our 2016 oven turns off when the timer runs out (and doesn't start unless the timer is set), so things don't go well if the cake is soupy in the middle and you decide to give it more time, but the timer has rung. I'd also say that this much batter in 2 loaf pans takes a long time to bake, but we didn't have a larger pan. We began with the temp set at about 6 o'clock; we turned it up when progress was slow, but I think it was slow because the oven had turned off. It got pretty brown before we decided the center was done enough. \nPour batter into prepared pans (grease and flour): 2 8 or 9\" rounds or 9 x 13 pan. Bake at 175-190 C or 375 (350 in the outdoor roaster oven is safer) for 25 minutes for rounds, probably 40 for 9 x 13, until golden, and wooden pick comes out clean.\nIn 2018 I tried doing upside down muffins, and it wasn't great. Though it made for less cake and more topping, something Jon approved of, the batter spilled from one, burning on the bottom of the oven, and some of the butter/sugar mix seeped out and burned, too. Lots of smoke. It might have worked in really big muffin tins, but the normal 1/2 cup size we had didn't go so well. The rest of the batter was in the red loaf pan, and it worked fine. Of course, we ate the muffins; we just didn't like all the smoke.\n\nNotes from year four, Gisbert Rico: I baked two cakes, one in a long silicone loaf pan, the other in a saucepan.  I used 2 T. of the brown sugar granules they have here for each cake, and used 1 t. baking soda instead of baking powder. They took a lot longer to bake than I expected, close to double. I could have drained the pineapple less, as a little more liquid might have been good. Near the end I turn the top heat element off so the top wouldn't continue to brown. In the past we've turned the whipping cream into butter by mistake, and we wondered if doing it in a tall container contributed. So we used a wider bowl, covered with a fruteria plastic bag with a hole for the whip attachment. It worked well.\n\nFor Jon's birthday I made the cake in the oval terra cotta. I used about 50 g butter, 3 pineapple rings, chopped fine, 1/3 cup walnuts (could have been more), 4 T. coarse brown sugar. I added just a little more milk to the batter. Baked at 175 C 20 min, turn, 8 min, then turn off top element (and convection fan on) 10 more minutes. 5 more with top element on.\n\n2019 Progreso piso: I baked in two pans from Dale and Aida, a pie place and a square pan. I did 25 g. melted butter in each, but they stuck, so I think going up to about 35 g. would be better. 2 T. brown sugar crystals scattered in each one, then about 1/3 cup chopped nuts in each, 2 T. coconut shreds in one. The cake itself had the first milk measure as coconut liquid from a can of coconut milk, unstirred, and and one egg, plus a little more egg from egg wash, less than a half-shell's worth. I used 1 t. baking soda, 1/2 t. cream of tartar, and a tablespoon of pineapple juice. Each pan had a ring and a half of pineapple, finely chopped. \nWe preheated to 160, approx, and I turned it up to 175 at some early point. The pans were hard to fit in the oven, sort of diagonal with the square in the back corner, the glass in front kitty corner. They baked for about 25 minutes, I think, though the timer didn't work for the second bit, so that's approximate. Things stuck when we turned them over.

Original here: http://markbittman.com/how-to-cook-everything-the-basics-rice-puddin/ ]\n\nOur stovetop is very unpredictable this year, (Calle Progreso 83) so I'll try an oven version.\nPreheat oven to 150 C (300 F)\ncombine in a pottery dish (or thick, oven-safe dish that can hold 6 cups):\n(4 cups) 910 ml whole milk \n(1/3 cup) 70 g. round white rice (any white rice will work)\n(1/3 ish cup) 75 g. sugar (this was plenty sweet. I think it could easily go down to 55 or 60 g. without a problem, especially if you use some raisins stirred in when you take it out of the oven; I used about 2-3 T.)\n1/4+ t. salt\n\nBake 30 minutes uncovered (I'm going to try just heat from the bottom, as both top and bottom tends to burn things these days), stir, bake 30 minutes more, stir again. [Note: I thought having the top heat on during the first 30 minutes wouldn't hurt as it was supposed to bake for about 2 hours, but the milk forms a bubble, and the bubble burned, so I had to drag away the burned part and ladle out the mixture and put it in a new pan so it wouldn't be contaminated. So no top heat!]\nMore directions from Mark Bittman:\nCook until the rice plumps and starts to become a more noticeable part of the mixture and the skin becomes more visible and darker, about 30 minutes more. Now the pudding is getting close to done, so check on it every 10 minutes, stirring each time (it should reach the right texture in 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the kind of rice you used).\n3. The pudding will be done before you think it’s done. The rice should be really swollen and the milk thickened considerably but still pretty fluid (it will thicken more as it cools). Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.\n\nTips: \nYou’ve got to use white rice in this recipe, but you have some choices: Long-grain aromatic rice (like basmati or jasmine) will deliver the most delicate texture and fragrance. Short- or medium-grain white rice (like Arborio) will be more thick and chewy. Supermarket long-grain rices will be somewhere in between.\n\n5 Ways to Change the Flavor:\n\n1. Substitute coconut, soy, rice, or nut milk for the milk.\n2. Stir in a piece or two of whole spice (cinnamon sticks, cloves, or nutmeg) at the beginning of cooking.\n3. Stir in a teaspoon of grated citrus zest at the beginning of cooking.\n4. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract after cooking.\n5.

In 2007, he helped The Times drill down into the taste history of sesame noodles in America, and specifically to the ones made and sold by Shorty Tang at the restaurant Hwa Yuan on East Broadway. Soft and luxurious, bathed in an emulsified mixture of sesame paste and peanut butter, rendered vivid and fiery by chili oil and sweetened by sugar, then cut by vinegar, this version brings home what used to be classic New York takeout. “The art is in the balance,” Mr. Schoenfeld said at the time, “between the salt and sweet, the sweet and the fire, and the fire and the acidity.”\n\nFeatured in: Cold Sesame Noodles: Without The Wait For Takeout. \n\nChinese, Noodles, Times Classics, Noodle, Peanut Butter, Sesame Paste, Easy, Quick, Appetizer, Side Dish, Vegetarian  Mark as  Cooked  3,024 ratings  \nINGREDIENTS\n1  pound noodles, frozen or (preferably) fresh\n2  tablespoons sesame oil, plus a splash\n3 ½  tablespoons soy sauce\n2  tablespoons Chinese rice vinegar\n2  tablespoons Chinese sesame paste\n1  tablespoon smooth peanut butter\n1  tablespoon sugar\n1  tablespoon finely grated ginger\n2  teaspoons minced garlic\n2  teaspoons chili-garlic paste, or to taste\n Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks\n¼  cup chopped roasted peanuts\nEmail Grocery List\nPREPARATION\nBring a large pot of water to a boil.

When the oven is up to temperature, pull dutch oven out, uncover, sprinkle in a good layer of germade or cornmeal, and carefully pour the batter in, trying not to smear it on the sides. It doesn't really need to be level. Try not to deflate. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake for 20 or more. Let cool some time so that it doesn't pill as you cut it. This has a pronounced flavor. The 1/4 t. yeast might not have been necessary, but I wanted to have a backup.

I got it from thestonesoup.com. Here are directions for developing a starter:\n\nday 1: In a clean bowl or jar, mix together 50g (2oz) flour, 50g (2oz) water and 2 tablespoons organic natural yoghurt. Cover with cling wrap and leave somewhere warm.\n\nday 2: Using a clean spoon, add 100g (4oz) flour and 100g (4oz) water. Mix to combine. Recover and leave in a warm place.\n\nday 3: Today you can make your first loaf. But you’ll need to use some yeast as well. When you’ve removed 200g starter. Replenish with 100g (4oz) flour and 100g (4oz) water. Mix to combine. Recover and leave in a warm place.\n\nday 4 onwards: Remove 200g starter and either use it to make bread or throw it away. Using a clean spoon replace with 100g (4oz) flour and 100g (4oz) water. Mix to combine. Recover and leave in a warm place\n\nsomewhere between about day 10 and day 15 Your starter should start to show signs of life. Basically it will start to bubble. When this happens you can stop using the yeast in with your bread. And you can start to keep the starter in the fridge and stop feeding it everyday. Aim to feed it (remove 200g (8oz) and replace with 100g (4oz) each flour and water) twice a week or more often if you’re baking more frequently.\n\nsource: http://thestonesoup.com/blog/2010/10/rustic-sourdough-the-secret-to-making-amazing-bread-at-home-5-ingredients-simple-baking/\n\nAlso consider reading through the method by the people who do artisan bread in 5 minutes a day: https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2020/04/20/easy-sourdough-starter-with-new-troubleshooting-tips/ ","creator":"Lori Forsyth","created":"201204261605","modified":"202004261105"},"Sourdough pancakes":{"title":"Sourdough pancakes","body":"Sourdough start is really good in pancakes or waffles, and a good way to use the start that some recommend you discard so you don't crowd out your fridge each time you feed it.

We've done it a few different ways (the way they do it has so much sugar in it that I have to be a conscientious objector). Here's the latest. Jon will try a variation with the sugar caramelized, and add it below.\n\n(Here's another variation: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/black-rice-pudding-233288)\n\nPlace in a casserole dish that will fit into the pressure cooker:\n2 c. Thai sweet black rice\n2 c. water\nput down a trivet, and add 1 1/2 c. water in the bottom, then with a foil strap lower in the bowl of rice and water. Bring to pressure, lower heat and cook 15 minutes. Let pressure release naturally. While that's happening, combine:\n35-40 g. coconut cream powder\n4-6 T. sugar\n1/4 t. salt\n1 c. boiling water\n\nOpen the cooker, lift out casserole. Stir the coconut mixture very carefully into the rice. Relock lid, bring back to pressure, cook for 2 minutes. Natural pressure release. Add a little more boiling water if it seems like it's needed. This isn't exactly how I did it, but the way I did it had the rice sticking to the bottom of the pan, so this is how I'm going to try in the future, unless Jon gets his version done first, in which case, I guess we'll edit this.\n\nJon's edit: I don't know how much sugar is in the \"real\" recipe, but I'm sure it's at least 1/2 cup, and maybe as much as 1 cup. I also assume the liquid is just coconut milk, if you have it.\n\nTo caramelize the sugar, put it into a dry frying pan in a fairly even layer, and slowly heat it until it starts to melt.*\n\n* Aside: It's a fascinating and somewhat frightening process. There's a very short time between \"melted/caramelized just right\" and \"burnt\". I don't remember the exact process, because I haven't done it very often, but this is what I remember. It is a key part of the right taste, though.\n\nWhen the edges start to liquify, swirl the pan around to encourage the melted parts to melt the unmelted parts. (Don't stir, though, or it just gets messed up.) When everything is completely melted, immediately remove it from the heat, and (carefully -- it may splatter) stir in heated liquid, which is probably the coconut milk, but may be just water.\n\n\n","creator":"Lori","created":"201302210238","modified":"201505062031"},"Sweet Potato Felafel":{"title":"Sweet Potato Felafel","body":"Type the text for 'Sweet Potato Falafel'\n\nBaked Sweet Potato Falafel Recipe found through 101 cookbooks\n\nThese falafel are Leon's most popular veggie dish to date.

Turn off the oven, leave the potatoes to cool, then peel.\n\nPut the sweet potatoes, cumin, garlic, ground and fresh coriander, lemon juice and gram/chickpea flour into a large bowl. Season well, and mash until smooth with no large chunks. Stick in the fridge to firm up for an hour, or the freezer for 20-30 minutes. When you take it out, your mix should be sticky rather than really wet. You can add a tablespoon or so more of chickpea flour if necessary (the water content of sweet potatoes varies enormously).\n\nReheat the oven to 400F/200C. Using a couple of soup spoons (put a well-heaped spoonful of mix in one spoon and use the concave side of the other to shape the sides) or a falafel scoop if you have one, make the mixture into falafelly looking things and put them on an oiled tray. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and bake in the oven for around 15 minutes, until the bases are golden brown.\n\nMakes about 18 falafel, enough for 4 - 6.\n\nReprinted with permission from Leon: Ingredients and Recipes by Allegra McEvedy.

Separately, mix leavenings, salt and flours together, sifting out lumps. Fold dry mixture into wet, stirring to moistening, not overmixing (though spelt is lower in gluten, so it's not as much of a worry, I believe). Pour into a small non-stick bundt pan or 10\" round lined with parchment. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden and wooden pick comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes then carefully loosen.\n\nI thought I'd make a little drizzle with the last of the lime curd, some coconut cream and powdered sugar, but found that the powdered sugar-covered cake on the package was a ruse; I was using cornstarch. So Then we found the pulverzuker to sprinkle on the cake. It was very nice warm.\n\nThe second time we made this I did a pineapple upside down thing in the small bundt pan; 60 g melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar mixed with a drizzle of blackstrap molasses mixed well, and chopped walnuts, maybe a heaping 1/4 cup, and chopped pineapple, a bit drained, also a heaping quarter cup or so.

I usually trust that my dishwasher has done enough, and I can't remember having a problem). Set down into hot water in cooler. Repeat with other jars, if desired. Yogurt should be set in 6-8 hours.
